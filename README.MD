# SEA Stage 2 Project

This is the template you will use to make your project. If you have not used Github or programmed a website before, that's OK! Part of the challenge is figuring out things you're not familiar with.

### Getting Started

1. Click the "Use as Template" button.

2. Copy/Download the repository to your own computer.

3. Edit the files using a text editor and preview your website by opening index.html with a web browser (double clicking the file should do it.)
