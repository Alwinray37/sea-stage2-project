# SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project

This is the instructions, requirements, and starter for stage two of the Snap Engineering Academy application process.

## Your Task:

<h3 align="center">Create a "catalog" website for something you're passionate about.</h1>

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used Github or programmed a website with JavaScript before, that's OK! Part of the challenge is figuring out things you're not familiar with.  

## Project Requirements:

 - Your catalog website should demonstrate your understanding of basic data structures: arrays and objects.
 - Make sure you're displaying data "dynamically" - if the data in your data structures changes, then your code should display those changes after a reload.
 - Add at least one extra feature to your catalog website that modifies the data or how it is displayed. Look at other websites displaying lists of data for inspiration.
 - Start from this template, but you can change anything you like. *The code in the template is written to help you get started, but there are absolutely ways to improve it.*
 - You must submit an original website. Please do not submit something youâ€™ve already done for a school project, internship, or client. 

## Getting Started

1. Create a Github account if you haven't already.

2. Click the green "Use as Template" button in the upper right corner, then choose the "create a new repository" option.  
  a. Choose yourself as the owner  
  b. Give your repository a name  
  c. Click "Create Repository"  

3. Copy or Download the repository files to your own computer. There are many ways to do this, it's up to you!

4. Start editing the website by using a text editor for the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `scripts.js` files. As you edit, preview your website by opening `index.html` with your web browser (double clicking `index.html` should open it in a web browser). When you're done, you should see something like this:

## Submitting

1. Publish your website to the internet! You can use any method you like, but we recommend [Github Pages.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)

2. Update your Github repository so it has the most recent version of your website's source code.

3. Submit the URL to your published website and the link to your Github repository to the google form in your email.
